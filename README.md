# Flappy-Bird---2nd-attempt
Improved version I guess.
I made this one less laggy and the code is more organized I think. I put Bird implements in its own class, but I still have to call for
the mouse clicks in main.cpp
I put a lot of comments asking some newbie's doubts throughout the code. If someone answered them I would really appreciate it :3
