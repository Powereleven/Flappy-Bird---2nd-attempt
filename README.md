# Flappy-Bird---2nd-attempt
Improved version I guess.
I made this one less laggy and the code is more organized I think. I put Bird implements in its own class, but I still have to call for
the mouse clicks in main.cpp
I put a lot of comments asking some newbie's doubts throughout the code. If someone answered them I would really appreciate it :3
PS: I know there are useless things like a parameter when creating an Obstacle that isn't used and an #include <list> that I didn't use.
  But please don't be so harsh one me, because I pretty much tested several options until I sticked to one, so I may have forgotten to 
  change some code and/or I let some commented things that don't do anything.
